# PokeTokenBar website

Static landing page for https://chattymin.github.io/PokeTokenBar/, maintained on the `gh-pages` lineage. App source lives on `main`. This branch does not build or replace the native app.

## Local preview and verification

```sh
npm ci
npm run preview
# http://127.0.0.1:8765

npm test
npm run design:check
```

`npm test` starts its own local server on port 18765, uses installed Google Chrome on this Mac, and saves screenshots plus results under `test-results/`. Set `CHROME_PATH` for a different local Chrome executable. The suite covers three languages, responsive layouts, light/dark themes, axe accessibility scans, keyboard controls, clipboard errors, no JavaScript and unavailable local storage. There is no website production build step.

## Design tools

Impeccable and Hallmark are project-local development tools, not website runtime dependencies. Their installed payloads are ignored by Git; `.codex/hooks.json` and these setup instructions are retained.

```sh
npm run design:install
```

This runs the official Impeccable 4.1.0 installer for Codex in project scope. The installed skill reports version 4.3.1 and engine 0.1.5 at this snapshot; the installer retrieves the upstream skill payload separately. Use the installed launcher for checks, so they don't fetch a new version on every run.

Hallmark 1.1.0 is installed at `.agents/skills/hallmark/` from [Nutlope/hallmark](https://github.com/Nutlope/hallmark/tree/main/skills/hallmark). On this Mac it can be reinstalled using:

```sh
python3 /Users/patrick.park/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/scripts/install-skill-from-github.py \
  --repo Nutlope/hallmark --path skills/hallmark --dest .agents/skills
```

Newly installed skills are available on the next task turn. The Impeccable installer writes Codex PostToolUse and Stop hooks. Reload/open this project and inspect `/hooks`; Codex may require trusting the new hook definition. Installed/enabled configuration is not evidence that the already-running parent task has reloaded it. The current redesign was checked explicitly with `npm run design:check`.

The official hook intentionally becomes a no-op if its launcher is missing. Our manual `design:check` command instead reports the missing installation and exits with failure. No CI, telemetry backend, external posting or scheduled automation was added.

## Sources of truth

- `PRODUCT.md`: product facts, constraints and image provenance.
- `DESIGN.md`, `tokens.css`: implemented visual decisions and tokens.
- `.impeccable/surfaces/landing.md`: this page's goal, sequence and direction.
- `docs/design-references.md`: ten inspected references, tool selection and post-build critique.

`index.html` includes readable English fallback content. `app.js` applies the English/Korean/Japanese dictionaries using text nodes, plus separately translated image descriptions and ARIA labels. Keep the fallback copy and dictionaries aligned when changing wording.

## Assets

Existing screenshots are product UI illustrations produced by the release workflow, not newly captured native-app screenshots. Captions label them as examples. `floating-pet-still.png` is the first frame of the existing `floating-pet.gif`; animation is user initiated. The local Bricolage Grotesque font is distributed under `assets/fonts/OFL.txt`, from the [Google Fonts source](https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/ofl/bricolagegrotesque).

## Publishing

The preview is local. Publishing requires reviewing the change and explicitly authorizing the `gh-pages` update; opening a preview does not deploy it. Preserve `.nojekyll` and the existing public anchors. Do not merge this orphan website branch into the app's `main` branch.
